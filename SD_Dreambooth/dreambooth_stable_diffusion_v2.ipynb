In addition to a vew minor formatting and QoL additions, I've added Stable Diffusion V2 as the default training option and optimized the training settings to reflect what I've found to be the best general ones. They are only suggestions; feel free to tweak anything and everything if my defaults don't do it for you.\n",

If this is your first time creating a model from scratch, I reccommend you check it out!"
